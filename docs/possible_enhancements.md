# Possible Enhancements for Z-News

## System Architecture Restructuring

### Tiered Architecture
1. **Core Library Layer**
   - Shared utilities for API interactions
   - Rate limiting and error handling
   - Data cleaning and standardization
   - Configuration management

2. **Collection Layer**
   - Weekly news collection module (current functionality)
   - New quarterly collection module with deeper historical analysis
   - Enhanced search parameters for different timeframes
   - Source diversification beyond DuckDuckGo

3. **Analysis Layer**
   - News volume tracking over time
   - Topic modeling to identify industry trends
   - Entity relationship mapping
   - Sentiment analysis for market perception

4. **Reporting Layer**
   - Weekly executive summaries (current functionality)
   - Quarterly in-depth lookbooks
   - Customizable report templates
   - Cross-entity comparative analysis

## Quarterly Lookbook Enhancements

### Data Storage and Management
- Implement a database (SQLite for simplicity or PostgreSQL for scale)
- Store all weekly results for historical analysis
- Track entity performance metrics over time
- Enable data versioning for comparison

### Trend Analysis
- Track news volume patterns by entity
- Identify recurring topics and themes
- Compare coverage against industry events
- Analyze correlation between news coverage and business performance

### Content Enrichment
- Add industry context to reports
- Include market analysis alongside news summaries
- Integrate competitor positioning maps
- Provide strategic insights based on news patterns

### Visualization Components
- News volume trend charts
- Topic distribution visualizations
- Sentiment analysis graphs
- Comparative coverage analysis

## Implementation Plan

2. **Phase 2: Quarterly Collection (2-3 weeks)**
   - Develop historical data collection capabilities
   - Implement time-based aggregation
   - Create quarterly search parameters
   - Build data comparison functionality

3. **Phase 3: Enhanced Analysis (3-4 weeks)**
   - Develop trend detection algorithms
   - Implement topic modeling
   - Create sentiment analysis pipeline
   - Build comparative analytics framework

4. **Phase 4: Lookbook Generation (2-3 weeks)**
   - Design lookbook templates
   - Implement visualization generation
   - Create executive summary roll-ups
   - Develop export options (PDF, interactive HTML)

5. **Phase 5: Automation (1-2 weeks)**
   - Implement scheduling system
   - Create automated pipeline for weekly/quarterly execution
   - Set up notification system for report availability
   - Develop self-monitoring capabilities

## Technical Considerations

- Consider migrating to async processing for better handling of rate limits
